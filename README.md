# Web_Scripting_Weekly_Projects
This is from one of my first programming classes where we covered HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript.

Hello,
First off thank you for looking at my old work.
This is from my first year of learning how to program so everything is a bit basic but this is where I got my start.

In each of the folders there is a word document that was included in the class and these files are my answers to the questions that
I was asked.

Any comments are appricated! Thanks :)
